CIS520 - Project 0
By: Nick George

In order to create a new test, one must update the C and header files for the test.c and test.h files, respectively. In there, you must state the name of your new test. For my alarm-mega, I updated the alarm-wait.c file where the other alarm tests were and added in the new definition for my alarm-mega.

Once saved, you are able to remake the files and the new test should become available given there are no errors.

Files changed:
/tests/threads/alarm-wait.c
/tests/threads/tests.h
/tests/threads/tests.c
